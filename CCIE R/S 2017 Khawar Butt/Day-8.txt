Border Gateway Protocol [BGP]

- The purpose of BGP is to connect 2 AS's to each other.
- It is generally run on the Edge Routers.
- BGP sets up relationship's with neighbors based on Unicast.
- There are 2 main advantages of BGP
  - Scalability
  - Gives you a lot of control to choose the best route

Configuring BGP between 2 AS's.

R1:

router bgp 1000
 network 1.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0
 neighbor 192.1.14.4 remote-as 400

Injecting Routes into BGP

Major netwokrs

router bgp 1000
 network 1.0.0.0

Subnets

router bgp 1000
 network 11.11.11.0 mask 255.255.255.0

Inject a route into BGP without using the Network Statement
205.1.4.0/24, 205.1.5.0/24, 205.1.6.0/24, 205.1.7.0/24

IBGP Configuration
1. Configure a Loopback on the Router and Advertise it in the IGP

R1
interface lo10 
 ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
!
router eigrp 100
 no auto
 network 192.1.12.0
 network 192.1.13.0
 network 10.0.0.0

2. Configure the IBGP Neighbor Relationship based on the Loopback

R1
Router bgp 1000
 neighbor 10.2.2.2 remote-as 1000
 neighbor 10.2.2.2 update-source lo11
 neighbor 10.2.2.2 next-hop-self

R2:
Router bgp 1000
 neighbor 10.1.1.1 remote-as 1000
 neighbor 10.1.1.1 update-source lo11
 neighbor 10.1.1.1 next-hop-self
